# D-Gait

Depression risk recognition based on gait: A benchmark



------

### Highlights in D-Gait Dataset

**(1) Large Data Scale**

The D-Gait dataset comprises 27,120 gait sequences collected from 292 volunteers. This extensive sample size provides robust support for data-driven methodologies.

**(2) Comprehensive Diversity**

The D-Gait dataset accounts for a wide range of shooting angles and clothing variations. Specifically, it features 16 uniformly distributed shooting angles from 0 to 180 degrees. Clothing variations include not only normal walking patterns but also factors such as walking with bags and walking in different clothing.

**(3) Reliability of Label**

 The reliability of the D-Gait dataset labels is ensured through the integration of three professional diagnostic scales: SDS, PHQ-9, and GAD-7. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of the labels.
