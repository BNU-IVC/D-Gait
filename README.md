### Highlights in D-Gait Dataset

**(1) Large Data Scale**

The D-Gait dataset comprises 27,120 gait sequences collected from 292 volunteers. This extensive sample size provides robust support for data-driven methodologies and enhances the reliability of research outcomes.

**(2) Comprehensive Diversity**

The D-Gait dataset accounts for a wide range of shooting angles and clothing variations. Specifically, it features 16 uniformly distributed shooting angles from 0 to 180 degrees. Clothing variations include not only two different normal walking patterns but also factors such as walking with bags.

**(3) Reliability of Label**

 The reliability of the D-Gait dataset labels is ensured through the integration of three professional diagnostic scales: SDS, PHQ-9, and GAD-7. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of the labels.
